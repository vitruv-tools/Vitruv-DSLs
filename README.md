Vitruv is a framework for view-based software development. It assumes different models to be used for describing a software system,
which are automatically kept consistent by the framework and its applications. For general information on Vitruv, see our [Wiki](http://vitruv.tools).

This DSLs project provides several languages to specify consistency preservation rules for keeping models consistent with the Vitruv framework.

## Installation
Vitruv can be installed in Eclipse via the [nightly update site](http://vitruv.tools/updatesite/nightly). A wiki page provides [detailed instructions for using or extending Vitruv](https://github.com/vitruv-tools/Vitruv/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Project Development

Vitruv, as well as the DSLs is realized as Eclipse Plug-ins and depends on the following Eclipse tools:
- Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) _as the modelling environment_
- Xtext _for language development_
- Xtend _for code_
